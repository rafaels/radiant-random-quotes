Radiant Random Quotes

Adds a random quote from a file to a radius tag.

The file has a quote and an author, quotes in pair lines, and authors in unpair lines.

You only need to add "<r:randQuote />" to your radiant page.

Obs. This project needs help, I'm just begining to learn ruby on rails. I'm glad if someone who have a litle bit more experience participates.
ps. Specs off, I don't know how to do yet.
